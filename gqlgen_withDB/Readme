1. mkdir databseConnector --> create databaseConnector.go
2. use gorm to connect and do operations on postgres DB
3. Modify schema --> generate updated code with modified schema
4. write schema.resolver.go


New Learning:
-- we can't redeclare same variable in Go like
  var abc int = 1
  ....
  ...
  var abc,err = 5

  But can do like
  abc := 7
  ....
  abc,err := 5, nil

  --> Reasoning is to avoid accidental shadowing of variables, like 
  unkowingly shadowing value of abc= 7 with 5. But it allows with := (strange!!!)
  here when used := --> it declares if not already declared, if already declared then
  just reassign new value (but must have one new variable on left side).
